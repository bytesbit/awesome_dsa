### 7. **Practice Problem-Solving**
   - Focus on solving problems on **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, and **InterviewBit**.
   - Start with **easy** and **medium-level** problems and then progressively move to **hard** problems.
   - Use the **tagging** system (like DP, DFS, Sorting) on these platforms to focus on specific techniques.

### 8. **System Design (For Senior-Level Interviews)**
   - Understand system scalability, caching, database sharding, consistent hashing.
   - Design scalable systems (URL shortener, social media news feed, rate-limiting systems).
   - Learn about distributed computing, load balancing, microservices, REST APIs.

### 9. **Mock Interviews**
   - Practice mock interviews on platforms like **Pramp**, **Interviewing.io**, or with a peer. This helps improve your problem-solving under pressure.

### 10. **Time Complexity and Space Complexity**
   - Analyze every solution with respect to both **time and space complexity**.
   - Understand **Big-O** notation thoroughly and be able to explain your choices.

### Conclusion:
- **Practice consistently** to gain fluency in problem-solving and pattern recognition.
- Focus on **optimizing** solutions rather than brute-forcing.
